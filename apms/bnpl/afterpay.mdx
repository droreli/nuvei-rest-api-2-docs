## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Show payment breakdown" icon="calculator">
    Display "4 payments of $X" prominently. Customers respond to smaller numbers.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Highlight zero interest" icon="percent">
    Emphasize interest-free and no fees if paid on time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product page placement" icon="eye">
    Show Afterpay messaging on product pages, not just checkout.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Complete address data" icon="map">
    Send full billing and shipping addresses for better approval rates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Declined Orders

If Afterpay declines, it's based on their risk assessment:

| Reason | Suggestion |
|--------|------------|
| Insufficient credit | Offer alternative payment |
| First-time user | May have lower limits |
| Cart amount | May exceed user's limit |

<Warning>
  You won't receive specific decline reasons. Afterpay handles customer communication directly.
</Warning>

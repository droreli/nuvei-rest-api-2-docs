## Messaging Requirements

BNPL providers require specific on-site messaging:

```html
<!-- Product page -->
<div class="klarna-messaging">
  <klarna-placement 
    data-key="credit-promotion-badge"
    data-locale="en-US"
    data-purchase-amount="29900">
  </klarna-placement>
</div>

<!-- Cart page -->
<div class="afterpay-messaging">
  Pay in 4 interest-free payments of $74.75
</div>
```

<Note>
  BNPL providers may require you to display installment messaging on product and cart pages. Check provider agreements.
</Note>

## Customer Eligibility

BNPL approval is not guaranteed. Providers assess:

- Order amount (min/max limits)
- Customer payment history
- Country/region
- Product category
- Customer age (18+)

Handle declined eligibility gracefully:

```javascript
if (response.transactionStatus === 'DECLINED') {
  // Don't reveal reason (privacy)
  showMessage('This payment option is not available for this order. Please try another payment method.');
}
```

## Refunds

Refund BNPL transactions like any other APM:

```json
POST /ppp/api/v1/refundTransaction.do

{
  "merchantId": "<merchantId>",
  "merchantSiteId": "<merchantSiteId>",
  "clientRequestId": "<unique_request_id>",
  "relatedTransactionId": "7110000000011234572",
  "amount": "99.00",
  "currency": "EUR",
  "authCode": "<original_auth_code>",
  "timeStamp": "<YYYYMMDDHHmmss>",
  "checksum": "<checksum>"
}
```

<Info>
  When you refund, the BNPL provider adjusts or cancels remaining customer payments automatically.

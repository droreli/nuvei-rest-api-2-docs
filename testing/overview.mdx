## Testing Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test all scenarios">
    Don't just test the happy path:
    - Test declines with various reason codes
    - Test 3DS failures
    - Test network interruptions
    - Test edge cases (max amounts, special characters)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use realistic test data">
    Use test data that mirrors production:
    - Realistic amounts
    - Valid address formats
    - Production-like customer data
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test webhooks thoroughly">
    Webhooks are critical for production:
    - Verify all status types
    - Test idempotency
    - Simulate retries
    - Validate checksums
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document test cases">
    Maintain a test case library:
    - Reproducible scenarios
    - Expected results
    - Pass/fail criteria
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

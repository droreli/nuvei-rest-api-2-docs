## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with monitoring mode">
    Deploy new rules in "monitor" mode first:
    - Track would-be triggers
    - Analyze false positive rate
    - Adjust thresholds before enforcement
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Balance security and conversion">
    Overly aggressive rules hurt legitimate sales:
    - Monitor decline rates
    - Track manual review volume
    - Measure conversion impact
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use rule combinations">
    Single indicators are often insufficient:
    - Combine velocity + geography
    - Layer device + identity checks
    - Use risk scores as tiebreakers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review regularly">
    Fraud patterns evolve:
    - Monthly rule performance review
    - Adjust thresholds as needed
    - Add rules for new attack vectors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Configuration Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always use HTTPS URLs">
    All URLs must use HTTPS:
    - Response URLs (success, failure, pending, back)
    - DMN URLs
    - Withdrawal URLs
    
    HTTP URLs will be rejected.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Implement DMN handlers first">
    Before going live:
    1. Implement your DMN endpoint
    2. Validate checksum on every DMN
    3. Handle all status types (APPROVED, DECLINED, PENDING, ERROR)
    4. Return HTTP 200 OK promptly
    5. Test with sandbox transactions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use consistent response pages">
    Create clear response pages for customers:
    - **Success**: Order confirmation with details
    - **Pending**: Explain APM processing times
    - **Failure**: Clear error message with retry option
    - **Back**: Return to cart with items preserved
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rotate Secret Key periodically">
    For security:
    1. Generate new Secret Key from Control Panel
    2. Update your server-side code
    3. Test in sandbox first
    4. Deploy to production during low-traffic period
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Secret Key not visible | Insufficient permissions | Request Admin role from your administrator |
| URL test fails | URL not accessible | Verify URL is public and returns 200 |
| DMN not received | IP not whitelisted | Add Nuvei IP ranges to firewall |
| Wrong redirect | URL not saved | Verify settings were saved (check confirmation message) |

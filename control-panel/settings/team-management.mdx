## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Apply principle of least privilege">
    Assign users only the permissions they need:
    - Finance team → Finance_Actions or Finance_ReadOnly
    - Customer support → Operations_Actions
    - Risk analysts → Risk_Actions
    - Developers → Developer only
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regularly review user access">
    Quarterly review recommended:
    - Remove inactive users
    - Update roles for job changes
    - Verify no unnecessary admin access
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use dedicated accounts">
    Avoid shared accounts:
    - Creates accountability in audit logs
    - Prevents access issues when employees leave
    - Ensures proper 2FA per user
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Deactivate instead of delete">
    When employees leave:
    - Deactivate immediately
    - Preserve audit history
    - Delete only if required by policy
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

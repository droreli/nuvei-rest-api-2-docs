# Introduction

Welcome to the Nuvei server-to-server REST 2.0 API integration guide.

<Note>
  This is a REST 2.0 **Beta** version.
</Note>

Nuvei's API is simple, easy-to-use, secure, and stateless, which enables online merchants and service providers to process consumer payments through Nuvei's digital payment Gateway.

This guide describes the API's services and functionality, and is intended for developers by providing all necessary integration information, including the necessary requests and responses.

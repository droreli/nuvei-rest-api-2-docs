# What's New in REST 2.0

REST API 2.0 represents a significant evolution in how you integrate with Nuvei. Here's what's changed.

## At a Glance

| Feature | REST 1.0 | REST 2.0 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Authentication | Checksum calculation | Simple API key header |
| Endpoint structure | Action-based URLs | Resource-based REST |
| Payment lifecycle | Separate IDs per call | Single `paymentId` links all |
| HTTP methods | Mostly POST | Proper GET/POST/PUT/PATCH |
| API specification | Custom docs | OpenAPI/YAML |

## Key Improvements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Simplified Authentication" icon="key">
    **Before (REST 1.0):**
    ```
    checksum = SHA256(merchantId + merchantSiteId + clientRequestId + amount + currency + timestamp + secretKey)
    ```
    
    **Now (REST 2.0):**
    ```bash
    -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    No more checksum calculations. Just include your API key in the request header.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="True RESTful Design" icon="code">
    **Resource-based URLs:**
    - `POST /payments` — Create a payment
    - `GET /payments/{id}` — Retrieve payment details
    - `POST /payments/{id}/refunds` — Refund a payment
    
    **Proper HTTP methods:**
    - `POST` for creation
    - `GET` for retrieval
    - `PUT/PATCH` for updates
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Unified Payment Lifecycle" icon="link">
    Each payment returns a `paymentId` that links all subsequent operations:
    
    ```
    POST /payments → paymentId: "abc123"
    POST /payments/abc123/fingerprint
    POST /payments/abc123/challenge
    POST /payments/abc123/refunds
    ```
    
    No need to repeat merchant credentials or transaction details in follow-up calls.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Better Developer Experience" icon="laptop-code">
    - **OpenAPI/YAML specs** — Generate SDKs, use Postman collections
    - **Consistent responses** — Predictable JSON structure
    - **Clear error messages** — Actionable error codes and descriptions
    - **Sandbox parity** — Test environment mirrors production exactly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Migration Considerations

<Warning>
  REST 2.0 is a new API, not a version upgrade. You'll need to update your integration code, but the concepts remain familiar.
</Warning>

### What Stays the Same
- Same Nuvei account and credentials portal
- Same payment processing capabilities
- Same settlement and reporting

### What Changes
- New base URLs (`api.nuvei.com/payment-api/`)
- New authentication method (API key)
- New request/response formats
- New endpoint paths
